		The Electronics Engineering Association of Christ college of Engineering has come to an existence on April 19 2017 and officially named as ECTA-ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOCRATS ASSOCIATION.
                The program began with prayer and welcome speech by Ms Sreelekha T,HOD,ECE Department.Principal Dr Sajeev John delivered the presidential address and talked about the motto of association.
                The lighting of the lamp was then done by the dignitaries.Inauguration of department book bank was done by Fr John Paliakkara, Executive Director of CCE.An invited talk by Mr Arjun Shankar,Engineer at ISRO was followed.
                His talk focused on the history of space exploration and role of satellite in communication.Later on,there were presentations by student members.ShineTharakan,student of S4 ECE provided a presentation on “Electronic Dance Machine”.
                Mary Christina Joy of S2 ECE provided a paper presentation on “Electronic Tolling”.At last Athul Parameswaran,secretary of ECTA delivered the vote of thanks.
