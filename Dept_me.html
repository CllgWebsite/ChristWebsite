                    The Association of Mechanical Engineering, namely Real Persistent Mechxians (RPM) came
                    into existence on 29 th March 2017.The association was founded with the aim of integrating the
                    entire mechanical Dept. under a common roof. The Motto ‘One Breed One Blood’ was adopted
                    by the association.
	      </p>
              <p>The Association Inauguration took place on 29th of March, Wednesday, 2017. The arrangements for the association Inauguration began a week prior to the Inauguration day. The Students had arranged the corridors with charts which depicted various achievements
                  of the Mechanical Discipline and Engineers. The logo of the association was brought into physical existence using suitable materials. A Mini-Expo which exhibited various parts of an automobile was held in the first floor of the college building during the inauguration day. </p>
	      <p>The Programme commenced by 9:45 AM. Mr. Reynold Jose, HOD of the Mechanical Dept., welcomed the gathering. The chief guest of the day was Mr. Kuriachan T.K, Senior Manager-Training (retired.) of Cochin Shipyard. Following the welcoming address, the Director of CCE,
                  Fr. John Paliakara gave the Director’s address. Unveiling of the Logo, made by the Mechanical Dept. students for their new born association, was done by Fr. John. The Principal, Dr. Sajeev John spoke for a few minutes before the association was officially inaugurated by lighting the lamp.
                  The Joint Director of CCE Fr. Joy Payyappilly gave a talk after the official inauguration. </p>
              <p>A Class was held by the chief guest and resource person of the day Mr. Kuriachan T.K who spoke about his career, Reasons for unemployment in the country, depreciation of prices of commodities and other relevant topics. The Duty of giving vote of thanks was taken up by Mr. Kiran Joy, 
                  The secretary of the Department Association RPM, at the end. The program winded up by 11:45.</p>
              <p>It was declared that the association Real Persistent Mechxians will work for the betterment of the students and will be socially committed throughout its period of existence.</p>
