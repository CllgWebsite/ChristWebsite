                                established in the year 2015, with excellent infra structure is affiliated to Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam University, Kerala (KTU). 
                                The department offers Undergraduate program (B Tech) with an intake of 60 students. The goal of the department is to create engineers 
                                of high technical skills in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering field suitable for employment in reputed firms and for higher studies.
                                The faculties help the students to attain this goal by conducting seminars and projects. Today, Electrical engineering has a wide reach in all 
                                spheres of technology and has given rise to new varieties of opportunities like design and application of Solar Photo-Voltaic cells, fuel cells, 
                                wind conversion turbines, etc. Electrical engineers play a major role in the design of systems related to all these areas. The department provides 
                                complete support to make the students gain the fundamental knowledge and theories that govern modern Electrical Engineering.
                                Thus EEE department at CCE prepares each student for careers in this constantly evolving discipline.</p>

                    <p> one-day workshop was organized by Ms. Emilin Thomas Kangappadan, Asst. Professor, CCE, on “Basics of AutoCAD” on 20th December 2018
                        for the first semester students. During the morning session, the students were taught the basics of the software and in the afternoon session they were made 
                        to draw a plan and elevation of a room. They were also asked to place electrical equipments in the room such as fan, light socket, etc and to show the wiring of these equipments.

                    <br/>
                    <p>
                     After the session, the students divided themselves into 6 groups of 9 members each. Each group was further divided into 3 subgroups of 3 members each. Each main group 
                     selected a particular room of a building and different dimensions were selected by each subgroup. The students drew the plan and elevation of the room along with the electrical equipment 
                     present in the room using AutoCAD software. The wiring diagram was also included in the project. An estimate was prepared by each group focusing on the amount of wire required for the room. 
                     The project was submitted by the students on 1st January 2018.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    The workshop gave the students an idea on how to find out the estimate of the electrical accessories required during the construction of a building.

                    Association day of Electrical and  Electronics Engineering department. The program was organized by the electrical department association BETA ( Battalion of Electrical Techno Artificers).
                    <br/><br/>
                   He began the session by introduction about the generation of energy. The session was proceeded by the topics of generation methods, transmission and distribution  of  power. The topic was conveyed effectively to the students.
                    <br /><br/>
                   It has been said that only 80% of power is generated in  Kerala and rest is imported from other places, various methods was explained by Mr. Adhil Naser,  in order to prevent this import of energy from other places as an Electrical engineer.
                   <br /><br/>
                   Different  methods for reducing the power consumption was explained by him. The role of an  electrical engineer in reducing the consumption of power &  power consumption of different type of televisions and fan was also discussed.
                   <br /><br/>
                   The method of setting up a electrical bill was shown by him. How the divisions of price for different levels of units also was explained. Finally the design of a solar system was discussed.</p>
