                                A P J Abdul Kalam Technological University, with a yearly intake of 60 students, offers the students professionally accredited full time 
                                under graduate programmes in Civil Engineering. Civil Engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines and includes the designing,
                                planning, construction, and maintenance of the infrastructure. It also deals with roads, bridges, buildings, dams, canals, water supply and 
                                numerous other facilities that affect the life of every human being. With the rapid increase in the infrastructural development of the whole world,
                                the role of civil engineering has been found to increase drastically in the present era. The need for a society of excellent civil engineers
                                has now become an inevitable factor that can help the overall development of any country. The Department is hence committed to a culture of continuous 
                                improvement in the Civil engineering skills of a student through well equipped labs, excellent faculty and library facilities. Apart from academic activities
                                the department also conducts various workshops and training programmes for both students and faculty, on the latest trends in the field of civil engineering.
                                We also provide the students of our department with a healthy learning environment that promotes innovation and individual improvement.</p>

                <p>The Civil Engineering Association of Christ college of Engineering has come to an existence on April 19 2017 and officially named as RACE (Receptive Association of Civil Engineers).
                    This was formed with a fundamental motive of integration and encouragement of Civil engineering students of Christ family by incorporating socially relevant and developmental activities.
                    The formal inauguration of this association was done on April 19 2017 by Shri: Jayprakash Narayanan, a veteran in the field of Civil Engineering. Along with this an expert lecture was given by him 
                    on the topic “Opportunities and Challenges in Civil Engineering Profession”. The session was really fruitful for the budding civil engineers and it could generate a positive vibe among the students towards
                    the professional aspects of Civil Engineering. In addition to this, agrant expo was also being arranged which exhibited the real talents of Civil Engineering students of Christ College of Engineering.
                    The major models included historical structures , innovative prototypes and creative models.</p>
