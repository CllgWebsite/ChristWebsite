                    <p>Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara was born on 10 February 1805 at Kainakary, Kerala. At
                        the age of five he began his studies in a village school, called kalari. When he was 13, he
                        joined the
                        seminary at Pallipuram for his priestly training. While he was in the seminary, his parents and
                        his
                        eldest brother died of an epidemic. On 29 November 1829, he became a priest. <br><br>

                        Saint Chavara was instrumental in founding two Catholic Religious Congregations - one for men,
                        Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), and the other for women, Congregation of Mother of Carmel
                        (CMC),
                        for the spiritual renewal and all round development of the society.

            </div>

            <div class="text-justify pt-2">
                <p>
                    Starting seven ashrams and a convent in different parts of Kerala, Chavara initiated a spiritual
                    movement among the people of Kerala. He established the first Catholic Sanskrit School, a major
                    seminary
                    and a printing & publishing house at Mannanam. He directed that every church should start a school
                    attached to it and encouraged children even poorer sections to attend the schools by supplying
                    midday
                    meal and dress for them. He founded a ‘Home of Charity’ to take of the destitute, the beggars, the
                    uncared sick and the old. He also organized the first voluntary charitable association in Kerala for
                    self-help among the needy. <br><br>

                    Even in the midst of such manifold activities, he found time to write several literary and spiritual
                    books in prose as well as verse. Among them, ‘Anastasyayude Rakthasakshyam’ is the first narrative
                    poem
                    and ‘Nalagamangal’ the first chronicle of history in Malayalam. He knew seven languages - Malayalam,
                    Tamil, Sanskrit, Syriac, Latin, Italian and Portuguese. <br><br>

                    Essentially, however, Saint Chavara was a man of prayer and great charity. He lived for 65 years and
                    died on 3rd January 1871. His sanctity was first recognized by the Church, when Pope John Paul II
                    beatified him at Kottayam (India) on 08 February1986. Later, he was canonized a "saint" at Saint
                    Peter's
                    Square, Rome by Pope Francis, on 23 November 2014. Saint Chavara is the heavenly patron of all CMI
                    and
                    CMC institutions. Let us pray to him to intercede before God for all our needs, especially for
                    success
                    in our studies. <br>

            <h2>Important Sayings of Saint Chavara</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Children, you are God’s gift in the hands of your parents <br>
                The children who have a love of God and fear of God will love and respect their parents <br>
                Trust your mother, God will hear the prayers of the mother as yours<br>
                Food is for the body, so is wisdom for the intellect<br>
                Go to school regularly and recall to mind what is taught during the week<br>
                Laziness fosters evil habits<br>
                Let your friends be those who love God<br>
                The day in which you have not done any good to your fellowmen will not be recorded in your book of
                life<br>
                Keeping bad books is like hiding fire in hay<br>
                Regular reading of good books and meditating on them will illumine the mind<br>
                Attain punctuality by means of a regular timetable<br>
                You angels will be turned to devils, if you fall into evil situation<br>
                You ought to reach home before evening and take part in the evening prayers<br>
                Desire that others love you, and not that they fear you<br>
                Take special care to keep modesty while you sit, walk or lie down<br>
                You are to forgive and forget the wrongdoings of others<br>
                Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell who you are<br>
                What you earn by deceit and theft will melt like snow<br>
                Idleness is the mother of all vices and would induce one to the habit of drinking<br>
                Both stinginess and extravagance are equally sinful<br>
                Had you not lighted the lamp during the day time, you could have lit it during night<br>
                Do not insult or trouble the poor<br>
                God decides your vocation and it is you to choose it<br>
                If your parents have left any obligation of restitution, fulfill it with diligence and devotion<br>
                Even if you are grown in age and maturity, you have to respect your parents and submit to them<br>
                Do not hate your own brethren<br>
                It is the duty of children to look after their parents<br>
                Do not be the cause for your parents to shed tears on account of you<br>
                The humble man is the greatest among men<br>
                Since you belong to God, you have to give yourself back to God<br></p>

        <h2>About CMI</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Congregation of Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI) is the first indigenous religious congregation in the
            Catholic Church of India. Fr. Thomas Palackal, Fr. Thomas Porukara and Fr. Kuriakose Chavara of the
            Syro-Malabar Church of apostolic origin, who felt that “a lot of good had not been done due to the absence
            of a Thapasu Bhavanam (House of Discipline) and a Darsana Veedu (House of Vision)”, had the challenging
            vision of providing spiritual leadership and fostering unity and growth in the Kerala Church. With the
            permission of Bishop Maurelius Stabilini, the then Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly, they founded a religious
            house at Mannanam on 11 May 1831. Jacob Kanianthara who later became the first professed brother in the
            Congregation, cooperated with the founding fathers from the beginning. The name of the Congregation was
            ‘Servants of Mary Immaculate’.Soon, some more priests and clerics joined the founding fathers and thus a
            small religious community took shape. On 8 December 1855, the religious Congregation was canonically
            approved and the first eleven fathers made their religious profession. Blessed Chavara, the only surviving
            founder, was appointed the first superior of the Congregation. Since, during the early period of the
            religious Congregation, the Vicars Apostolic of Verapoly were Carmelites, the congregation had come under
            the Carmelite influence; hence, the rules of the Carmelites with some modifications were given to them in
            1855.

            In 1860, the community was affiliated to the Order of Carmelites Discalced with the name, ‘Third Order of
            the Carmelites Discalced’ (TOCD). The Constitutions were approved ad experimentum by the Apostolic See in
            1885. In 1958, the name was changed to ‘Carmelites of Mary Immaculate’ (CMI). The Congregation was granted
            pontifical exemption in 1967.From the very beginning, the religious life in the congregation was rooted in
            the Indian, Oriental and Carmelite spiritual traditions. Being contemplatives in action, the members engaged
            in such activities as the Church in Kerala was in need of at particular times. They preached retreats,
            conducted seminaries for the training of the local clergy, met the challenge of educating the youth and
            disseminating Christian literature, laboured for the propagation of the faith and for the reunion of
            separated brethren, undertook works of mercy and started charitable institutions.The apostolate of the CMI
            Congregation gathered new dimension and momentum as mission areas were entrusted to it beyond the boundaries
            of Kerala. In 1962, Chanda became the first mission ordinariate of the Syro-Malabar Church and was entrusted
            to the Congregation. Since then, more mission dioceses and regions were erected in Central and North India.
            There are now four dioceses in North India and one in South India entrusted to the Congregation, viz.,
            Chanda, Jagdalpur, Bijnor, Rajkot and Adilabad. These five dioceses are headed by CMI Bishops. This is
            indeed a milestone in the progress of the CMI missions and an abiding evidence of the recognition by the
            Apostolic See. Besides, many members are engaged in various kinds of apostolate in other parts of India and
            also in other countries. The Prior General, assisted by four Councillors, is at the head of the
            administration; the Prior General’s House at Chavara Hills in Kochi is the headquarters of the Congregation.
            For the sake of administration, the Congregation is divided into 15 provinces, one region and 7 sub-regions.
            At present the Congregation has about 3000 members including 9 bishops, 1766 priests, 1 permanent deacon, 26
            brothers and 1200 brothers in formation. More than half of the priests are working outside Kerala, of whom
            about 367 are doing pastoral services in 27 countries around the world.</p>

        <h2>CMI Education Policy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We, the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate, after the example of our founder Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara,
            consider education as the integral formation of the human person for the fulfilment of his/her individual
            and social responsibilities. <br><br>

            Our educational endeavors aim at forming leaders who are intellectually competent, spiritually mature,
            morally upright, psychologically integrated, physically healthy and socially acceptable, who will champion
            the cause of justice, love, truth and peace, and who are ever open to further growth.<br><br>

            The secret of the success of our educational institutions is a community of teachers who are committed to
            their vocation, professionally competent, morally upright, just and humane in dealings, culturally sensitive
            and who grow in the true vision of education.<br><br>

            We aspire towards creating a just and humane society where dignity of the human person is respected, where
            unjust social structures are challenged, where our cultural heritage of ahimsa, religious harmony and
            national unity are upheld, and where the poor and the marginalized are specially taken care of.<br><br>

            We have to reach out to the families, primarily of the students, to assist them in their needs, to share in
            their joys and sorrows, and to help them experience love and freedom so that the students realize that our
            educational institutions are an extension of their homes.<br><br>

            Our institutions are open to all students irrespective of caste and creed; they are accepted and cherished
            as they are and are helped to grow in their cultural, social and religious traditions. As they are
            privileged to be in our institutions, they will also have the right to get acquainted with the person of
            Jesus Christ and his Gospel. Being institutions established and administered by and for a minority community
            based on religion, they will give preference to Christians in admissions and appointments and have a special
            concern for the faith formation of the Christian youth.<br><br>

            Our institutions are also open to society at large by making their resources available for the ongoing
            education and growth.<br><br>

            For the realization of this CMI goal of education, we invite students, parents and teachers to share this
            vision and to cooperate with us wholeheartedly.
            <br><br>
            All Round formation: Aims at- the formation of future leaders who are intellectually competent, spiritually
            mature, morally upright, psychologically integrated, physically healthy and socially acceptable, who will
            champion the cause of Justice, love, truth and peace and who are ever open to further growth.<br><br>

            A community of committed teachers: Partners in the mission; professionally competent, morally upright, just
            and human in dealings, who are ready to adapt and grow according to the needs of time, while being faithful
            to the CMI vision of education.<br><br>

            Family centered education: CMI educational institutions believe and uphold the centrality of family in
            shaping a just society, and hence believe in reaching out to the families, primarily of the students, to
            assist them in their needs, to share their joys and sorrows, and to help them experience love and freedom so
            that the students experience their educational endeavour in CMI institutions as an extension of their home
            life.<br><br>

            A just and humane society as the ultimate goal: CMI educational endeavours must contribute to the building
            of a just and human society, where the dignity of the human person is respected, unjust social structures
            are challenged, our cultural heritage is upheld, religious harmony and national integration are promoted and
            where the poor and the marginalized are specially taken care of.<br><br>

            Open to all aspiring students: Irrespective of their caste and creed, the students are accepted and
            cherished as they are, and are helped to grow in their cultural, social and religious traditions. Community
            oriented: CMI educational institutions have to reach out to the community, by making their resources
            available for the ongoing and non- formal education.<br><br></p>
