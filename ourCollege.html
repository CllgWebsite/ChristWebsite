            <h3>About College</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Christ College of Engineering, established in 2015, is a new entrant in the field of
                professional education providers. The College is managed by the CMI congregation of Devamatha Province,
                Thrissur and is part of Christ Educational and Charitable Trust, Irinjalakuda. CMI fathers have an
                enviable track record of setting up top notch educational institutions, especially in Southern India;
                where-in God-given talents are nurtured, sound values are fostered and undesirable tendencies are
                corrected to pave the way for character formation and personality integration in the students. The idea
                for this institution was born out of the aspirations of the local people of different strata about the
                need for a professional educational institution at Irinjalakuda, which were conveyed to the CMI fathers.
                Keeping in mind the local aspirations, Christ College of Engineering aims to be a premier destination
                for engineering education in the immediate future, following in the footsteps of the many illustrious
                institutions that the CMI congregation has established and that are annually churning out holistically
                formed global citizens</p>
